By pressing the "New" button at the bottom of the explorer a data source can be created. To edit a data source, simply select it in the explorer.
When creating a data source there are a number of fields that need to be filled out, which fields these are depends on the input type. Some inputs might require a file upload as well. The file size of those uploads might be limited by your server settings.

You can also join two data sources or flows. To do so press the "Join" button at the bottom of the explorer view. This will display a dialog that'll guide you through the steps.
